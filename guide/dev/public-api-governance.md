# Public API Governance

C# `public` is CLR visibility, not an automatic supported SDK promise.

Bukit's supported external surfaces are CLI behavior, configuration and theme
shapes, template objects, report schemas, and the `bukit-plugin-v1` process
protocol. Bukit does not currently distribute a general-purpose Core CLR SDK.
Third-party process plugins exchange JSON and do not reference Bukit CLR
assemblies.

## Check

`bash scripts/checks/public-api-drift.sh check Release`

The check compares the compiled public and protected surfaces with
`docs/governance/bukit-core-public-api-baseline.v1.json`. It is a
maintainer-local governance tool, not a general CLR SDK declaration.

## Diagnostics And Exit Codes

Diagnostics are sorted as `<category>: <assembly>::<type>: <detail>`.

| Category | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `breaking` | An exported type or public member was removed. |
| `review-required` | An exported type, public member, or governance metadata changed. |
| `protected-review` | A protected member changed and needs review. |
| `type-shape-review` | An exported type signature changed. |
| `contract-shape-review` | A `plugin-wire-contract` or `serialized-contract` type changed. |
| `aot-review` | An `aot-serialization-surface` type changed. |
| `unclassified` | A new type has no approved classification. |
| `gate-error` | Input, baseline, capture, or snapshot processing failed. |

The command exits `0` for an exact match, `1` for valid drift requiring
review, and `2` for invalid input or a gate error.

## Review A Legitimate Change

1. Run `bash scripts/checks/public-api-drift.sh snapshot OUTPUT Release`.
2. Review every type/member diff and assign owner, classification,
   compatibility, migration horizon, and reason.
3. Run the relevant schema, protocol, or AOT contract tests.
4. Replace the governed baseline only in the reviewed change.
5. Run the self-test, real check, `ci-fast`, and Architecture tests.

Never infer removal safety from zero repository-local consumers. Access
narrowing remains a separate major-version task.

## Baseline Review Vocabulary

Every governed type uses one classification and one compatibility value.

| Classification | Use |
|---|---|
| `aot-serialization-surface` | AOT serializer context surface. |
| `cross-assembly-implementation` | CLR-visible implementation consumed across Bukit assemblies. |
| `implementation-public` | Public implementation detail, not an external SDK promise. |
| `persisted-internal-format` | Internal persisted-format surface. |
| `plugin-wire-contract` | `bukit-plugin-v1` JSON protocol surface. |
| `serialized-contract` | Serialized report or payload shape. |

| Compatibility | Review policy |
|---|---|
| `1.x-do-not-narrow` | Keep accessible through 1.x. |
| `1.x-migration-safe` | Change only with an approved 1.x migration. |
| `1.x-shape-stable` | Preserve the serialized or protocol shape through 1.x. |
| `2.0-candidate` | Consider narrowing only in a reviewed 2.0 change. |
| `not-a-clr-contract` | CLR-visible implementation with no external CLR contract promise. |

## Snapshot Safety Boundary

`snapshot` requires an explicit `OUTPUT` path. It will not overwrite the
governed baseline, an existing file, directory, or link; it accepts a new path
only inside the repository or the system temporary directory and creates it
with no-overwrite semantics. Canonicalization resolves existing links/reparse
points and rejects aliases or path escapes. Path comparison is ordinal on every
host, so differently-cased aliases may fail closed rather than risk escape.

This boundary defends ordinary maintainer mistakes, existing links/reparse
points, aliases, path escapes, and overwrites. It does not claim resistance to
a malicious same-account process that races to replace a validated parent path
between validation and file creation.

## CI Scope

`ci-fast` runs the fixture-only self-test first, then one real configured Core
surface check. The self-test must not run a real Core snapshot or check.
